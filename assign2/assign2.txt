Assignment 2: Due 11:59PM March 13th

The openweathermap.org site provides weather data. We can access, for example,
the weather in Houston, by sending a request to

http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Houston,us&units=imperial

Write a program that will read from a file a list of cities. It will then
get the temperature and the current condition (for example, sunny or cloudy)
from the webservice mentioned above. The program will then display, in sorted order of 
the city name, the current temperature and the weather condition. 
It will also report the hottest city and the coldest city.
